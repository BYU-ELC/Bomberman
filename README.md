Sources, code, and files for the Bomberman video-game project

This videogame is designed to outline the process of controller inputs to video outputs. When a user presses a button on the controller, the signal is sent through the USB to the Rasberry Pi. This will then be sent through the Bomberman [code] while the video is displayed onto the screen.
